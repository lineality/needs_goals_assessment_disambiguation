# User Needs and Goals Assessments: Disambiguation
As ever, context, input-structure, interpretation, loom large.

Over years of doing needs-goals-assessments and product-design I found a pattern in the apparent indeterminacy of the customer's responses to what I (from my perspective and context) thought was a single question: What do you need? What should you use that fits what you need? What will be useful to you that fits what you need? etc. 
But they would variably interpret the question in ~five ways. So I switched from trying to ask one question to asking them separate questions and tracking their answers over time.

1. What do you do and use now?
2. What do you need now?
3. What will you need in the med-term (foreseeable) future?
4. What do you think you can/will be able to do? 
(Very often people think the possible is impossible 
and shut down, in terms of their own ability.)
5. What do you think can be delivered to help you? 
(Very often people think the possible is impossible 
and shut down, in terms of tools and workflow.)
